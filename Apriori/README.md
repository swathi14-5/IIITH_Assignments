Description
Problem Overview:
The objective of this assignment is to implement the Apriori for frequent itemset mining.

Tasks:
1. Implement Apriori algorithm and run the program for BMS_spmf dataset. (All sub-methods required to build the Apriori algorithm (except the main one) are given in the starter file. You can choose to implement any other way you feel comfortable)


2. Change the minimum support value and comment on the resultant frequent itemsets that you get with Apriori algorithm.

 

Submission:
The final submission of this lab assessment should be made on Olympus. Submit the code either in .ipynb format or .py format and also submit the output that you get for different minimum_support value in a separate output.txt file.


For e.g. - 
output.txt:
min_sup=0.1
<Program output>
min_sup=0.01
<Program output>

 

Dataset:
We will be using the BMS_spmf dataset. The dataset contains product ids present in each transaction made by the customer in a shop.
