Explainable_AI-Task 2) Try modifying the code on Bike rental dataset and see how the package tries to explain the amount of bikes rented correspond to the various environmental conditions
10
Visualize_CNN-Task 1) The code given shows the image output after passing through each layer of a model. Implement a model with CNN layers (preferably similar to the model from NN assignment2) and show the output of a sample image after each CNN layer similar to the starter code.
