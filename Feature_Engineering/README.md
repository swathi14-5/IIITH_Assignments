Introduction
Feature engineering is one of the most important skills needed in data science and machine learning. It has a major influence on the performance of machine learning models and even the quality of insights derived.

In this assignment, we will learn some important techniques and tools that will help you properly extract, prepare, and engineer features from your dataset.

Tasks
Demonstrate the following Feature Engineering techniques mentioned in the notebook using a dataset of your choice:

Label Encoding
One Hot Encoding
Mutual Information
Importance from Decision Trees
Correlations
PCA
LDA
T-SNE
